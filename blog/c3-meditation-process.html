  <h6 style="font-weight:bold">Meditation Process</h6>
  <p>As this week's task was to completely redesign a responsive website, the "process over product" concept was introduced to us. It is essentially a reminder that our focus is on learning, as opposed to producing perfect products. Having this in mind was helpful as I got 'stuck' multiple times throughout the process. It helped me come to terms with spending more time than I thought on seemingly small things</p>
  <p>I continued my read of Chade-Meng Tan's <i>Search Inside Yourself</i> this week, focusing on meditation. Meditation allows you to be "relaxed and alert at the same time" (pg. 96). I'm starting to see why this is linked to the programming world.</p>
  <p>This particular section of the chapter stood out to me:<blockquote>“Let us begin by sitting comfortably. Sit in a position that enables you to be both relaxed and alert at the same time, whatever that means to you. Or, if you prefer, you may sit like a majestic mountain, whatever that means to you.
Let us now take three slow, deep breaths to inject both energy and relaxation into our practice.
Now, let us breathe naturally and bring a very gentle attention to your breath. You can either bring attention to the nostrils, the abdomen, or the entire body of breath, whatever that means to you. Become aware of in breath, out breath, and space in between.
(Short pause)
If you like, you can think of this exercise as resting the mind on the breath. You can visualize the breath to be a resting place, or a cushion, or a mattress, and let the mind rest on it, very gently. Just be. “(Long pause)
If at any time you feel distracted by a sensation, thought, or sound, just acknowledge it, experience it, and very gently let it go. Bring your attention very gently back to the breathing.
(Long pause)
If you like, let us end this meditation by inviting joyful inner peace to arise.
Breathing in, I am calm.
Breathing out, I smile.
This present moment,
Wonderful.
(Short pause)
Thank you for your attention.”
 ”</blockquote></p>
 <p>Its a very practical look at meditation which resonates with me and I think I will commit myself to doing this regularly.</p>
